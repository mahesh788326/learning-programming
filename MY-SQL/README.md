# DBMS Lab SQL Programs

A comprehensive collection of SQL scripts designed for hands-on learning and mastery of database concepts covered in university-level DBMS labs. This repository features fully standalone SQL implementations for key topics including table creation, DML operations, aggregate functions, join operations, set operations, nested queries, and views. Every script is ready to run with no external prerequisites.

## Contents

- **1.1 DBMS Installation**  
  Installation walkthrough and system familiarization (no SQL needed).

- **1.2 University Database System**  
  Creation of relational tables: Students, Courses, Enrollments, Instructors, Course_Instructors.

- **2.1 DML Commands**  
  Data insertion, selection, updating, and deletion.

- **2.2 Aggregate Functions**  
  Usage of `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `COUNT` and `GROUP BY`/`HAVING`.

- **3.1 Join Operations**  
  All join types: inner, outer, cross, natural, self, equi.

- **3.2 Set Operations**  
  Implementation of `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `MINUS` or their equivalent logic.

- **3.3 Nested and Correlated Subqueries**  
  Practical examples of subqueries and correlated subqueries.

- **3.4 Views**  
  View creation, modification, insertion/deletion, constraints, and drop—all fully demonstrated.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```
    git clone 
    https://github.com/Coder-mohammad/MY-SQL.git
    ```
2. **Setup:**
    - Use any relational database system (recommended: MySQL or Oracle). Scripts are standard SQL, but for advanced features (`CHECK OPTION`, `FORCE`, `READ ONLY`) refer to your DBMS documentation.
3. **Run the Scripts:**
    - Open your preferred SQL editor or command-line interface.
    - Copy-paste code sections for each program as required.
    - Data and table setups are included for every program.

## Lab Structure & How to Use

- Each SQL file/program is **standalone**—no cross-dependency.
- You can execute each one directly after copy-pasting into your DBMS environment.
- Sample data is provided for meaningful query results.
- Comments and logical steps guide code execution and understanding.
- For features specific to Oracle or MySQL, refer to comments for compatibility.

## Topics Covered

- Database schema design
- Data manipulation (DML)
- Aggregate functions and data analytics
- Relational joins (all types)
- Set operations
- Subquery logic and correlation
- Views, constraints, and view management
