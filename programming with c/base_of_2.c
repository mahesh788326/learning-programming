/*Program Description
Alice and Bob are playing a game. Each player rolls a regular six faced dice 3 times.

The score of a player is the sum of the values of the highest 2 rolls. The player with the highest score wins, and the game ends in a Tie if both players have the same score.

Find the winner of the game or determine whether it is a tie.

Input Format
A single line of input contains six space-separated integers A1, A2, A3, B1, B2 and B3 â€” the values Alice gets in her 3 dice rolls, followed by the values which Bob gets in his 3 dice rolls.


Output Format
Output on a new line Alice if Alice wins, Bob if Bob wins and Tie in case of a tie.*/
